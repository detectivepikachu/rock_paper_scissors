<bold>Rock, Paper, Scissors</bold>
<p> Here I learnt:</p>
<ul>Using a Math.random function for words</ul>
<ul>Organizing my code for it to work</ul>
<ul>Knowing when to use the "string"</ul>
<ul>There is a place to use swtich statements and ifelse statement. Logical operators cannot be used in switch and it is for boolean statements</ul>
<ul>What level of silly mistakes I can make</ul>
<ul>Need of comments</ul>
<ul>Leaving space before and after strings</ul>
<ul>If your code is not working as a whole then try testing it in parts</ul>
<ul>The inportance of saving versions on github</ul>
<ul>When wanting to use a function elsewhere, use "var = function()"</ul>
<ul>Using if/else to play rounds</ul>
<ul>If a variable is equal to a number then no declaration is needed (yet to work on this one)</ul>
<ul>Using 'break' to stop loops</ul>
